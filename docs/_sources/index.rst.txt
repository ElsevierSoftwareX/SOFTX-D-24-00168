What is SmartRPA
================

**Robotic Process Automation (RPA)** is a technology which automates mouse and keyboard interactions by means of a software (SW) robot to remove intensive routines. The current generation of RPA tools is driven by predefined rules and manual configurations made by expert users rather than automated techniques.

**SmartRPA** is a cross-platform tool that tackles such issues. It allows to easily record event logs and to automatically generating executable RPA scripts that will drive a SW robots in emulating an observed user behavior (previously recorded in dedicated UI logs) during the enactment of a routine of interest.

Architecture
============

The architecture of SmartRPA integrates five main SW components.

| 
| Key features include:

* **Action Logger**, log user behaviour, cross-platform, modular, supports wide range of applications;
* **Log Processing**, generates both CSV and XES event log;
* **Event abstraction**, abstracts events to a higher level;
* **Process Discovery**, selects the most suitable routine variant to automate and generates high-level flowchart diagram, thus skipping completely the manual modeling activity;
* **Decision Points**, discover differencies between multiple traces in a process and build a new routine based on user decisions;
* **RPA**, implements and enacts a SW robot emulating a routine reflecting the observed behavior (either the most frequent one or the one based on decision points). Available both as a cross-platform Python script and as a UiPath project.

A list of events supported by the Action Logger is available in `SmartRPA_events.pdf <https://github.com/bpm-diag/smartRPA/blob/master/images/SmartRPA_events.pdf>`_.
